# A Python Program That Finds Important Frequencies With The FFT and Finds Their Peaks Whilst Accounting For Overtones by Calculating the Fundamental Frequency Utilizing the YIN Algorithm and Removing the Mathematical Multiples Then Finally Passing the Sound Wave Through a Low Pass Filter (APPTFIFPWAOMCMFTFAUYARMMTFPTSWTALPF)

APPTFIFPWAOMCMFTFAUYARMMTFPTSWTALPF attempts to seekth out notable frequencies using the FFT, and identify their pinnacles whilst considering their overtones by computation of the fundamental frequency by means of the YIN Algorithm. It doth then expunge the mathematical multiples and conduct the sound wave through a Low Pass Filter.

APPTFIFPWAOMCMFTFAUYARMMTFPTSWTALPF uses a CLI interface.
