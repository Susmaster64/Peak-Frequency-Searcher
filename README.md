# Peak-Frequency-Searcher
This is a Python script that takes an MP3 file as input and outputs the peak frequencies of the audio, as well as the corresponding notes and cents deviation from A440 tuning. It also allows for searching for peak frequencies within a set frequency range.

## Dependencies

This script requires the following Python libraries:

    -librosa
    -numpy
    -scipy
    (and probabbly some more now)

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

  `pip install librosa numpy scipy (+ whatever)`
  
## Usage
  
No. Look at the code and figure out yourself

## Problems

1. Jank
2. Future error
3. Does not have toggle
4. Only works with .wav
